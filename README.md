These policies mandate token rotation on a regular basis and reduce how long a compromised token is good for, while also providing a lever to reduce the use of less-secure PATs in your company. This public preview is available for all enterprises and organizations, and will be included in GHES 3.16.

Simplified dependabot.yml configuration with multi-directory key (directories) and wildcard / glob (*) support
June 25, 2024
advanced-securitydependabotsecuritysecurity-and-compliance
Dependabot version updates requires developers to configure and check in a dependabot.yml file. In the past, it was challenging for administrators to configure a dependabot.yml that works for all repositories without per-repo customization. With this change, you can now specify multiple directories of dependency manifests using the directories key. Directories can be configured with wildcards or globbing to make targeting easier as well. This will simplify the process of creating configurations and allow greater flexibility for developers who wish to customize their behavior.

CodeQL can scan C# projects without requiring working builds (public beta)
June 20, 2024
advanced-securitycode-scanningcodeqlsecuritysecurity-and-compliance
CodeQL, the static analysis engine that powers GitHub code scanning, can now analyze C# projects without needing a build. This public beta capability enables organizations to more easily roll out CodeQL at scale. Previously, CodeQL required a working build to analyze C# projects. By removing that requirement, our large-scale testing has shown that CodeQL can be successfully enabled for over 90% of C# repos without manual intervention.
This new way of analyzing C# codebases is now enabled by default for all code scanning users on GitHub.com. CodeQL CLI users can enable this feature using the build-mode: none flag, starting with version 2.17.6.
